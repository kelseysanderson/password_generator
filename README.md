# Password Generator

## Description
This is the third assignment for coding bootcamp. The password generator prompts the user to choose number of characters (8-128) as well as whether they want to include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters. After prompts are complete, it will generate a password with the specifications the user chose.
